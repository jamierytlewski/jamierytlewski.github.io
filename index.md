### About Me
I have been programming websites since 2001. I have worked for three different colleges/universities. During my time I have programmed in Classic ASP, PHP, and .NET (C#/VB). Most of my experience overall is on the back-end, but in the last four years I have had to concentrate on the front-end to make our sites more user-friendly and appeasing for our users. While at TechSmith I went from not knowing Sass to the person that was teaching Sass and the main person that did the code reviews. In my spare time I have created an Alexa Skill, Facebook Bot, and website that will tell you and show you were the Lansing River Trail is flooded.

### WORK EXPERIENCE

#### December 2018 – Present
##### Application Developer at Greenstone FCS, East Lansing

While at GreenStone I have been a champion to try and bring DevOps to the IS Department. Our team has been tasked with converting over two projects from Silverlight to an updated platform. We have been using the newest version of .NET and Angular for most of the apps.

I have also created a group named the Dev Hackathon where a group of eight developers meet weekly to create a new project. During these meetings we have had to delegate work that needs to be done, which I have been a lead in making sure we stay on path. Right now we are working on a project that uses React, GraphQL, ExpressJS, and Azure Active Directory.

The IS Department and Application Developers have separate book clubs and I have been the lead for two of the book club books.

#### March 2016 – Present
##### System Analyst at Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI
In charge of seven different websites of variable programming languages. The languages include Classic ASP, .NET, and PHP. I mostly did back-end programming, but also need to do the front-end programming. I have created a Facebook Bot that does quizzes and interacts with users. https://m.me/globalEDGEmsu 

For the globalEDGE website I have also used IBM's Watson to create a podcast from the blog entry. https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/globaledge-blog-podcast/id1439945015?app=podcast&mt=2

I have also used Ionic to create an app that we use for checking in members at our annual conference.

While there I was also in charge of two students per semester for three years. During that time I gave the students projects to work and had to give them annual reviews.

#### June 2014 – March 2016
##### Software Engineer at Techsmith, Okemos
Worked on TechSmith's CMS which used OpenText. Worked mostly front-end using Sass/CSS. and JavaScript. During my time there I created a Chrome extension that helped our users find the direct link to videos on the site. I also brought in techniques such as code linting to make sure the code that was being committed had to follow rules we put in place as a team. I created tests in TeamCity for the front-end which had not been in place prior.
